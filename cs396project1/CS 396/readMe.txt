TE.php: [Is a PHP file. 
It is an exact copy of my "WKUTEWebpage.htm", 
and hosting it will show the exact same webpage.
However, it has (php) code in it connecting
the database that I created on 'phpmyadmin.'
It also uses (php) to auto populate my datalist of school information.  
Right click and open with "text-editor" (I used sublime text) to view the code.

TE_S.php: [Is another PHP file and represents my second webpage, or the 
table of class information. Basically this is the file that the form action is sent to. 
VIA POST method. It is simply another html webpage where I use (php) to generate 
all the table data, similarly from the database.]

IN ORDER TO TEST: NOTE!!!: FOR TE.php & TE_S.php
1. YOU MUST HAVE XAMPP, AND HAVE IT RUNNING. SEE (XAMPPView.png)
2. THIS FOLDER (CS 396), MUST BE PLACED IN THE "htdocs" FOLDER WHERE XAMPP IS INSTALLED.
	FOR REFERENCE, THE LOCATION SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS: (C:\xampp\htdocs\CS 396).
3. TYPE THIS INTO YOUR PREFERRED BROWSER (I used Chrome) AS A URL: "localhost/CS 396/TE.php".
4. THIS SHOULD PULL UP THE LOCALLY HOSTED WEBPAGE FINE INSIDE YOUR BROWSER.
